# Hi, welcome to Slowcord!

Slowcord is a heavily modded Fosscord instance. You can browse it's source here: https://github.com/MaddyUnderStars/fosscord-server/tree/slowcord

## Here are some general instance-wide rules:

-   **Harassment, homophobia, transphobia, etc, violence, and hate speech are forbidden.**
-   Behaviour that harms the service - be it malicious/intentional or not - is strictly forbidden. This may include API abuse/spam, exploits, etc.
-   -   If you do discover an exploit/bug, it would be greatly appreciated if you could create an issue in the above repo, or DM @MaddyUnderStars#0000.
-   Any content that would be considered illegal in Australia is also forbidden. Additionally, if it is illegal in your own country, it shouldn't be here.
-   Bots/selfbots are allowed. If you would like an account to be given bot status, DM @MaddyUnderStars#0000.

These rules are non-exhaustive, but should give a good idea of what will be enforced.
